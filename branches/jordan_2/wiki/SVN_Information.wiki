#labels Phase-Implementation
= SVN Info and HOW-TO Page =

Ok boys, this is how you get it all functioningâ€¦

Visit
	
   * http://code.google.com/p/llamamelon/source/checkout *

Copy the link that has the *HTTPS*  (S IS KEY) and get your password via the link below.

Now take that link and type it into your terminal.  

Enter your password when prompted and voila, you are golden.

If you get problems (like I did asking for a log editor or SVN Editor or something) you have to edit your bash profile.

You should now be able to run all the normal svn commands you know and love:
  * checkout
  * status
  * update
  * add
  * delete
  * diff
  * etc


=== Notes ===
More will be added when we need to branch off the main trunk and make our own sandboxes to play in...
