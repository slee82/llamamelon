\section{Development Process}\label{Process}

In developing the BALL language, we followed the suggestion presented
by Prof. Aho during class: make a working prototype, and incrementally
add enhancements. During the early parts of the development, more
attention is focused on adding new features than testing, however each
team member must create his own test case with the changes he made.

Whenever a part of the language is finished, it is tested and reviewed
by the team. Feedback is then relayed to the team member responsible
for the subsystem (usually the one who merged the latest version to
trunk, as many modules are jointly developed by the team). There is
less of a focus on the traditional team roles, rather each team member
focuses on developing the compiler while also doing their job in team
administration.

\section{Style Sheet}\label{Style}

\begin{singlespacing}
\begin{verbatim}
/*
 * COMS W4119 PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES AND TRANSLATORS FALL 2009
 * Team llamamelon - BALL language
 * StyleSheet.java - style sheet for Java classes
 */

package style;

// package declaration comes after header, separated by one line
/*
 * header contains course name, team name, language name, file name, and a short
 * description of what the file is.
 */

// imports come right after, separated by at least 1 empty line
import java.util.Arrays;

import java.io.*;
// imports can have empty lines separating them, especially when importing
// different trees

import javabackend.SimFunction;
import javabackend.TeamObj;

// single line comments can use // or /* (for more important comments)
// two-line comments written like this are also permitted. For 3 or more, use /*

/*
 * Very important single-line comments are made like this
 */

/*
 * Multi-line comments also use this format. The maximum width for each line in
 * a multi-line comment is 80 characters from the start of the line (not the
 * start of the comment, which is after the space after a '*'.
 * 
 * 1.  this is how to write lists with numbers.
 * 2.  When a list goes over a line, the next line starts under the start of the
 *     first line of the list.
 *     ...
 * 10. If the numbering goes over 10, entries 1 to 9 need to have 1 more space.
 *     This way all list text starts at the same place. Having a list of more 
 *     than 10 members is discouraged.
 */

/**
 * Comments before a class uses Javadoc style. It is REQUIRED, even if just one
 * sentence. Give a brief description of what role it has in the compiler. 
 * 
 * Class names are capitalized on each word. 
 * - playerObj - WRONG 
 * - PlayerObj - RIGHT

     *
     * 1. comments for private methods are recommended.
     * 2. Javadoc style is optional. Can both be /* or /** or even //
     * 3. comments for methods that override a superclass method / implement an
     *    interface method are highly recommended it's not already documented in
     *    the superclass / interface. Otherwise, it's optional.
     * 5. Methods that override builtin classes' methods like toString() or
     *    hashCode() don't need to be commented.
     * 
     * Method names
     * 1. first letter of name NOT capitalized. However, words after that are
     *    captialized.
     * 2. Order of methods:
     *    a. public
     *    b. protected
     *    c. <no scope>
     *    d. private
     *    e. public static
     *    ...
     *    h. private static
     *    the names themselves can go in any order.
     * 
     * 1. Annotations like @Override are OPTIONAL. They go after the comment.
     * 2. Public methods cannot have underscores.
