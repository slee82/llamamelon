=The program:=

{{{
/* Got the calculations from : http://sbs-baseball.com/theory.txt */

/* Plate appearances */
stat batterPA = AB + BB;

/*probabilities*/
stat batterProbWalk = BB / batterPA;
stat batterProbSingle = (Hits - (2B + 3B + HR))/ batterPA;
stat batterProbDouble = 2B / batterPA;
stat batterProbTriple = 3B / batterPA;
stat batterProbHR = HR / batterPA;

simfunction basicSimulation is:
  
end;

/*This makes simFunc the active simulation function, for use in
all nested simulations (so we don't have to pass it multiple times).*/
activate simFunc;

sim((Astros, Dodgers, 3), (Orioles, Twins, 3), 3);
}}}
