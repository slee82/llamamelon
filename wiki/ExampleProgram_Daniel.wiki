=The program:=

/* Got the calculations from : http://sbs-baseball.com/theory.txt */

/*Batter plate appearances*/
stat batterPA = AB + BB;

/*Batter probabilities*/
stat batterProbWalk = BB / batterPA;
stat batterProbSingle = (Hits - (2B + 3B + HR))/ batterPA;
stat batterProbDouble = 2B / batterPA;
stat batterProbTriple = 3B / batterPA;
stat batterProbHR = HR / batterPA;
stat batterProbOut = 1 - (batterProbWalk + batterProbSingle + batterProbDouble + batterProbTriple + batterProbHR);

/*Pitcher Batters Faced*/
stat pitcherBF = (IP * 3) + Hits + BB;

/*Pitcher probabilities*/
stat pitcherProbWalk = BB / pitcherBF;
stat pitcherProbSingle = (Hits / BF) - pitcherProbHR - pitcherProbTriple - pitcherProbDouble;
stat pitcherProbDouble = Hits x .174 / BF
stat pitcherProbTriple = Hits x .024 / BF
stat pitcherProbHR = HR / BF


simfunction basicSimulation is:
  
end;

/*This makes simFunc the active simulation function, for use in
all nested simulations (so we don't have to pass it multiple times).*/
activate simFunc;

sim((Astros, Dodgers, 3), (Orioles, Twins, 3), 3);
