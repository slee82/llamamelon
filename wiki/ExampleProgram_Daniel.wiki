=The program:=

{{{
/* Got the calculations from : http://sbs-baseball.com/theory.txt */

/*Batter plate appearances*/
stat bPA = AB + BB;

/*Batter probabilities*/
stat bWalk = BB / bPA;
stat bSingle = (Hits - (2B + 3B + HR))/ bPA;
stat bDouble = 2B / bPA;
stat bTriple = 3B / bPA;
stat bHR = HR / bPA;
stat bOut = 1 - (bWalk + bSingle + bDouble + bTriple + bHR);

/*Pitcher Batters Faced*/
stat pBF = (IP * 3) + Hits + BB;

/*Pitcher probabilities*/
stat pWalk = BB / pBF;
stat pSingle = (Hits / BF) - pHR - pTriple - pDouble;
stat pDouble = Hits x .174 / BF
stat pTriple = Hits x .024 / BF
stat pHR = HR / BF


simfunction basicSimulation is:

    

end;

/*This makes simFunc the active simulation function, for use in the
following nested simulations (so we don't have to pass it multiple times).*/
activate simFunc;

sim((Astros, Dodgers, 3), (Orioles, Twins, 3), 3);
