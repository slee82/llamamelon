===Presentation: Monday - 21th December, 4:30pm - 5:00pm===

Language tutorial (written by entire team, 10-20 pages).
  * Chapter 1 of Kernighan and Ritchie is a good model of a language tutorial.
  * Describe a few representative programs that illustrate the nature and scope of your language.
  * A "hello, world" program is de rigueur.

Language reference manual (written by entire team, 20-30 pages).
  * Appendix A of Kernighan and Ritchie is a good model.
  * Give a complete description of the lexical and syntactic structure of your language.
  * Include a full grammar for your language.

Project Demo

    * The project demos will be held in the Computer Science Conference Room on the fourth floor of the Computer Science Building (next to the CS lounge) on Monday, December 21 and Tuesday, December 22.
    * Bring your final project report to the demo. The entire team should be present.
    * One person should start by giving a 10-15 minute demonstration of how a representative program is compiled and executed by your compiler.
    * The teaching staff will then present the team with a new program to compile and execute.
    * The demo will conclude with a 5-minute explanation of a piece of source code by its author.

Project Report

    * Here is a suggested outline of the chapters to include in your final project report.
    * Be sure to include the name of your language, the name of your team, the names of all team members and the roles they played on the cover page of your report.
    * For chapters 4-8, include the name of the author who wrote that chapter. Each of chapters 4-8 should be just a few pages.
    * Bring the final project report to your project demo on December 21-22, 2009.

    * Suggested Outline
         # Introduction (to be written by the entire team)
                * Use your language whitepaper.
         # Language tutorial (to be written by the entire team)
                * Make sure your translator will process all of the programs mentioned in your language tutorial.
         # Language reference manual (to be written by the entire team)
                * Make sure it includes a complete grammar for your language.
         # Project plan (to be written by the project manager)
                * State what process used was used to develop the language and its translator.
                * State the roles and responsibilities of each team member.
                * Include the implementation style sheet used by the team.
                * Show the timeline of what was done when.
                * Include your project log
         # Language evolution (to be written by the language guru)
                * Describe how the language evolved during the implementation and what steps were used to try to maintain the good attributes of the original language proposal.
                * Describe the change management process used by the team as the translator was implemented.
         # Translator architecture (to be written by the system architect)
                * Show the architectural block diagram of translator.
                * Describe the interfaces between the modules.
                * State which modules were written by which team members.
         # Development environment (to be written by the system integrator)
                * Software development environment used
                * Implementation languages and tools used
                * Libraries used
         # Test plan (to be written by the system tester)
                * Describe the test methodology used used during development.
                * Show programs used to test your translator.
         # Conclusions
                * Lessons learned as a team (to be written by the entire team)
                * Lessons learned by each team member (written by each team member)
                * Advice for future teams (written by the entire time)
                * Suggestions for the instructor on what topics to keep, drop, or add in future courses (written by the entire team)
         # Appendix
                * Include a listing of the complete source code with identification of who wrote which module of the translator.
